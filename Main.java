    //Do NOT Make any changes to the above code! You will learn more about Scanner later. For example when you run the code type 6 and 4 in the console. The console being where your code output will show. Enter the two numbers below where is asks what numbers you would like to do math with. (If you want different numbers than 6 and 4 type those IN THE CONSOLE!!!! Your code should compile no matter the numbers you enter into the console and give you what the mathamatical functions are below. Choose any two whole numbers besides 0)

    // 1. Print the sum of x and y.
   
    // 2. Print the difference of x and y.


    // 3. Print the product of x and y.


    // 4. Print the quotient of x and y.
